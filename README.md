### Description

This Android project is my first attempt at implementing a Driiible [mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/18526342-Mobile-App-iOS-Android-UI) using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). I didn't copy their assets or fonts, but I did my best to reproduce their layout using Jetpack composable functions.
