### Description

This Android project is my first attempt at implementing a Driiible [mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/18526342-Mobile-App-iOS-Android-UI) using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

### Details

The pre-written list of books is loaded dynamically through a LazyColumn. The percentage indicator is [drawn](https://github.com/spike/Reader/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/github/spike/bookreader/booklist/DrawPercentageIndicator.kt) using the Canvas. And this layout has been tested on different screens with different screen resolutions and densities.
