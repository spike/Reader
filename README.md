### Description

This Android project is my first attempt at implementing a Driiible [mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/18526342-Mobile-App-iOS-Android-UI) using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). I didn't copy their assets or fonts, but I did my best to reproduce their layout using Jetpack composable functions.

### Details
This application is just a learning exercise in UI implementation. It's just a mockup. It's not using any underlying data. The list of books uses a pre-written String array of books and percentages.

But that array of books is loaded dynamically through a LazyColumn. The percentage indicator is implemented programmatically. And this layout has been tested on different screens with different screen resolutions and densities.
